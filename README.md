# ❄️ Cooling-System: Real-Time Cold Storage Monitoring

Cooling System is a high-fidelity monitoring solution designed for cold chain logistics and warehouse management. It provides real-time visibility into temperature-sensitive environments to prevent spoilage and ensure regulatory compliance.



## 🚀 Key Features

* **Real-Time Telemetry:** Instant feedback on internal temperature and humidity levels.
* **Safety Threshold Logic:** Integrated status indicators that transition to 'Critical' (Red) if temperatures deviate from the $2^{\circ}C$ to $8^{\circ}C$ safety window.
* **Predictive Analysis:** Displays AI-calculated predicted temperatures to anticipate cooling failures.
* **Ambient Outside Tracking:** Live synchronization with Tomorrow.io API to correlate internal fluctuations with external weather conditions.
* **Responsive Industrial UI:** Optimized for warehouse tablets and control room monitors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React (Vite)
* **Animation:** Framer Motion (State-aware hover effects)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Custom glow engine)
* **Data Handling:** Axios & Tomorrow.io API

Since you are building a Cold Storage Monitoring Service, your README should reflect the professional, mission-critical nature of the project. In cold storage, data accuracy and uptime are everything, so we should emphasize "Safety Thresholds" and "Compliance."

Here is a refined README and the Git instructions to handle your node_modules.
